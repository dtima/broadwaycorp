# Frontend Task: PushNchat Listings Module Implementation

## Role Assignment
- **Primary**: Frontend Developer
- **Support**: UI/UX Designer, Backend Developer

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive, responsive, and performant Listings module for PushNchat that enables users to create, browse, search, and interact with business listings across different categories and locations.

## Context
The Listings module is a central feature of PushNchat, allowing businesses to publish offers and requests with various durations and visibility options. Users need to discover relevant listings through search, filters, and recommendations, with optimized performance for mobile devices and variable connectivity in African markets.

## Pre-Implementation Analysis

### 1. Documentation Review
Begin by analyzing these key resources:
- `/docs/development-docs/ui-ux/home-page.md` - Core listings UI specifications
- `/docs/development-docs/ui-ux/forms/listing-submission/form-flow.md` - Listing creation flows
- `/docs/development-docs/business-model.md` - Listings business requirements
- `/docs/development-docs/pushnchat-technical-doc.md` - Technical specifications
- `/docs/development-docs/ui-ux/media-guidelines.md` - Media handling guidelines

### 2. Codebase Exploration
Analyze the existing codebase to understand current implementation:

```
// Commands to execute
1. Explore the src/components directory for existing UI components
2. Check for existing API integration in src/app or src/pages for listings
3. Look for utility functions related to listings
4. Examine current routing structure for listings pages
5. Investigate existing state management for listings data
```

- Investigate existing components for listing cards, grids, or details
- Check for form implementations related to listing creation
- Review API integration patterns for fetching listing data
- Examine media handling components for listing images
- Identify search and filtering implementations

### 3. Technical Gaps Assessment
Based on documentation and code exploration, identify:
- Missing listing components or features
- Incomplete form validation for listing creation
- Search and filtering limitations
- Performance issues in listing display
- Media handling optimizations needed
- Offline capability gaps

## Deliverables
1. Complete Listings module frontend implementation
2. Listing creation and management interfaces
3. Listing discovery and search components
4. Listing detail views with media handling
5. Category and location filtering system
6. Payment integration for listing creation
7. Responsive UI for all screen sizes
8. Offline support for critical operations

## Technical Requirements

   - Implement geolocation-based filtering
   - Add sorting options (newest, price, relevance)

2. **Listing Display**
   - Create listing detail page with all information
   - Implement contact options (message, WhatsApp integration)
   - Build related listings section
   - Develop share and save functionality

### Phase 3: Listing Creation & Management
1. **Creation Form**
   - Create multi-step form with progress preservation
   - Implement media upload with preview and validation
   - Build category and subcategory selection
   - Create location picker with map integration
   - Implement form validation with error handling

2. **Management Interface**
   - Build listing management dashboard
   - Create edit and renew functionality
   - Implement listing analytics display
   - Add delete and archive options

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. **Payment Integration**
   - Integrate payment for premium listings
   - Implement promotion upgrade options
   - Create subscription handling for recurring listings

2. **Offline Support**
   - Implement offline caching for viewed listings
   - Create offline form submission queueing
   - Build sync mechanism for reconnection

## Error Detection & Resolution

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Data Fetching Problems**:
   - If listings aren't loading, check React Query configuration
   - For pagination issues, verify cursor implementation
   - Solution: Review TanStack Query documentation and implement proper error boundaries

2. **Form Submission Errors**:
   - If validation errors are unclear, enhance Zod schema error messages
   - For submission failures, implement proper error display and retry mechanisms
   - Solution: Reference form patterns in `/docs/development-docs/ui-ux/forms/listing-submission/form-flow.md`

3. **Media Upload Issues**:
   - If image uploads fail, implement chunked uploading with retry
   - For image optimization problems, use Next.js Image component properly
   - Solution: Follow guidelines in `/docs/development-docs/ui-ux/media-guidelines.md`

4. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - If listing grid performance is poor, implement virtualization
   - For slow initial load, optimize critical rendering path
   - Solution: Use React profiler to identify and address bottlenecks

5. **Offline Mode Failures**:
   - If offline detection isn't working, implement robust online/offline detection
   - For sync issues, create proper conflict resolution strategy
   - Solution: Test thoroughly with network throttling and disconnection

## Self-Assessment Criteria

Evaluate your implementation against these criteria:

### Functionality Assessment
- Does the listings module support all required features?

- Are loading states properly implemented for all async operations?
- Do forms provide clear validation feedback?
- Is the offline experience seamless for users?

### Performance Assessment
- Do listings load efficiently, even on slow connections?
- Is image loading optimized with proper lazy loading?
- Are transitions and animations smooth on lower-end devices?
- Is initial load time minimized for critical content?

### Code Quality Assessment
- Is the code properly typed with TypeScript?
- Are components well-structured and reusable?
- Is there appropriate separation of concerns?
- Is error handling comprehensive?
