# UI/UX Task: PushNchat User Flows & Journey Mapping

## Role Assignment
- **Primary**: UI/UX Designer
- **Support**: Frontend Developer

## Objective
Design comprehensive user flows and journey maps for PushNchat's core features, ensuring intuitive navigation, logical progressions, and optimal user experiences for the diverse user roles across the platform.

## Context
PushNchat serves multiple user types (consumers, businesses, admins) with distinct goals across various modules (Listings, BizConnect, SME Hub). Each user journey must be carefully mapped to ensure intuitive progression through tasks while accommodating the constraints of mobile-first usage and variable connectivity in African markets.

## Deliverables
1. User persona profiles for key user types
2. Complete user flow diagrams for all core journeys
3. Wireframes for key screens in each journey
4. Decision trees for complex interactions
5. Error and edge case handling flows
6. Low-fidelity prototypes for validation
7. Documentation of interaction patterns
8. Navigation structure and information architecture

## Technical Requirements
- Create mobile-first user flows with responsive considerations
- Design for offline-first interactions where possible
- Ensure logical progression through multi-step processes
- Create consistent navigation patterns across the platform
- Design appropriate loading and error states
- Optimize flows for low-bandwidth environments
- Support authentication and authorization boundaries
- Create intuitive onboarding experiences

## Expected Outcome

These flows should address the needs of all user types, accommodate the constraints of the target markets, and provide a solid foundation for the detailed UI design phase.
