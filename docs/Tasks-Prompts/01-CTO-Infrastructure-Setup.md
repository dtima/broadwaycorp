# CTO Task: PushNchat Core Infrastructure & Architecture Setup

## Role Assignment
- **Primary**: CTO
- **Support**: DevOps Engineer

## Objective
Create the foundational infrastructure and architecture for PushNchat to support the African-focused, mobile-first platform with authentication, real-time capabilities, and scalability across different regions.

## Context
PushNchat is a comprehensive platform designed for African businesses, focusing on connecting and empowering businesses through Listings, BizConnect, and SME-Hub services. The platform needs to handle low-bandwidth environments, support mobile users (95% of traffic), and implement secure authentication flows.

## Pre-Implementation Analysis
Before beginning implementation, perform the following discovery tasks:

1. **Documentation Review**:
   - Review `/docs/development-docs/pushnchat-technical-doc.md` for technology stack and architecture decisions
   - Analyze `/docs/development-docs/business-model.md` to understand the business requirements
   - Examine `/docs/development-docs/production-auth-setup.md` for authentication requirements
   - Study `/docs/product-team/CTO.md` to understand the role responsibilities

2. **Codebase Analysis**:
   - Inventory existing files in `/src` to understand current state
   - Examine any existing `package.json` and configuration files
   - Analyze current directory structure and module organization
   - Identify any existing infrastructure code (Terraform, Docker, etc.)

3. **Technical Gaps Assessment**:
   - Identify missing core infrastructure components
   - Evaluate any existing codebase against the required architecture
   - Document discrepancies between current and target states
   - Prioritize infrastructure elements based on dependencies

## Deliverables
1. Complete architecture diagram showing all system components
2. Infrastructure-as-code templates for GCP deployment
3. Project structure with appropriate module separation
4. Authentication implementation strategy
5. Database schema definitions and relationships
6. API endpoint structure and standards document
7. Performance optimization strategy for African markets

## Technical Requirements
- Implement a microservices architecture using Next.js, React, Fastify, PostgreSQL, Firebase Auth
- Create a clear separation between authentication, listings, BizConnect, and SME-Hub services
- Design for mobile-first with progressive enhancement
- Optimize for low-bandwidth environments with offline capabilities
- Structure the database with PostgreSQL using JSONB for flexibility
- Implement Firebase Authentication with NextAuth.js integration
- Create secure middleware for route protection and role-based access

## Implementation Approach
1. Begin by examining existing infrastructure in the codebase
2. Create a GCP project structure with Terraform scripts
3. Set up Firebase project and configure authentication settings
4. Establish the Next.js project structure with appropriate separation of concerns
5. Configure database connections and initial schema
6. Implement authentication flows and route protection
7. Set up continuous integration pipeline configuration
8. Document the architectural decisions and constraints

## Error Detection & Resolution
During implementation, be prepared to handle these common issues:

1. **Environment Configuration Issues**:
   - If environment variables are missing, create a comprehensive `.env.example` file
   - For configuration conflicts, implement a hierarchical config resolution system

2. **Dependency Conflicts**:
   - If package version conflicts occur, analyze the dependency tree with `npm ls`
   - For incompatible packages, research alternatives or implement compatibility layers

3. **Authentication Integration Failures**:
   - If NextAuth.js and Firebase integration fails, consult `/docs/development-docs/production-auth-setup.md`
   - For token handling issues, implement a refreshing strategy with secure HTTP-only cookies

4. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - If API response times are slow, implement appropriate caching strategies
   - For network limitations, design offline-first capabilities and progressive enhancement

## Self-Assessment Criteria
Evaluate your implementation against these critical success factors:

1. **Architecture Quality**:
   - Does the architecture support the three core modules (Listings, BizConnect, SME-Hub)?
   - Is there clear separation between concerns and services?
   - Does the design minimize cross-service dependencies?

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Is the architecture optimized for low-bandwidth environments?
   - Are there appropriate caching mechanisms in place?
   - Does the system degrade gracefully under poor network conditions?

3. **Security Implementation**:
   - Is authentication properly implemented with secure token handling?
   - Are routes protected appropriately based on user roles?
   - Is sensitive data properly secured throughout the system?

4. **Scalability Design**:
   - Can the infrastructure scale horizontally as user numbers grow?
   - Is there proper separation to allow independent scaling of components?
   - Are there potential bottlenecks that would limit growth?

## Documentation Requirements
Create comprehensive documentation including:

1. Architecture diagram with all components and their interactions
2. Infrastructure-as-code setup instructions
3. Local development environment configuration guide
4. API standards and conventions document
5. Authentication flow documentation
6. Security considerations and implementation details

## References
- `/docs/development-docs/pushnchat-technical-doc.md` - Core technical specifications
- `/docs/development-docs/production-auth-setup.md` - Authentication requirements
- `/docs/development-docs/business-model.md` - Business logic requirements
- `/docs/Rules/Next.js-rules.md` - Framework standards
- `/docs/product-team/CTO.md` - Role responsibilities and expected outcomes

## Specific Tasks
1. Set up the GCP project structure with development, staging, and production environments
2. Configure Firebase project and authentication settings
3. Design database schema with appropriate relationships between core entities
4. Create the API architecture with clear RESTful endpoint conventions
5. Implement the token-based authentication system with HTTP-only cookies
6. Design the service-to-service communication pattern
7. Configure caching strategy for improved performance
8. Establish observability setup with logging, monitoring, and alerting

## Key Considerations
- Ensure the system can handle intermittent connectivity common in African markets
- Design for multiple environments (dev, staging, production)
- Implement security best practices throughout the stack
- Create a scalable infrastructure that can grow with the platform
- Optimize cost efficiency for startup operations

## Expected Outcome
A fully configured infrastructure and architectural foundation that enables the development team to build and deploy the PushNchat platform with confidence, security, and scalability in mind.
