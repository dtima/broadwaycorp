# DevOps Task: PushNchat CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment Architecture 

## Role Assignment
- **Primary**: DevOps Engineer
- **Support**: CTO

## Objective
Design and implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and deployment architecture for PushNchat that ensures reliable, automated, and secure deployments across development, staging, and production environments.

## Context
PushNchat requires a robust deployment infrastructure to support continuous delivery of new features while maintaining high availability. The platform serves users across Africa, often with limited connectivity, making deployment reliability and rollback capabilities crucial. The system will be hosted on Google Cloud Platform with a microservices architecture.

## Deliverables
1. Complete CI/CD pipeline configurations using GitHub Actions
2. Docker containerization setup for all services
3. Deployment automation scripts for GCP services (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, etc.)
4. Environment configuration management system
5. Monitoring and alerting setup
6. Rollback and recovery procedures
7. Documentation for the entire DevOps infrastructure

## Technical Requirements
- Set up GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, and deployment
- Configure Docker containers for Next.js frontend and Fastify backend services
- Implement GCP-based infrastructure with Terraform or similar IaC tools
- Create separate deployment environments (dev, staging, production)
- Configure Google Cloud Artifact Registry for container image management
- Implement automated testing in the CI pipeline
- Set up Cloud Monitoring for observability
- Configure appropriate security policies and access controls

## Specific Tasks
1. Create base Docker configurations for all service types
2. Design and implement GitHub Actions workflows for each service
3. Set up infrastructure-as-code using Terraform for GCP resource provisioning
4. Configure secret management for sensitive credentials
5. Implement automated testing and code quality checks
6. Set up deployment verification and health checks
7. Configure monitoring dashboards and alerts
8. Implement automatic and manual rollback procedures
9. Create traffic splitting for canary releases

## Key Considerations
- Design for zero-downtime deployments
- Optimize for cost efficiency in cloud resource usage
- Implement security best practices at every stage
- Create self-healing and auto-scaling configurations
- Design appropriate monitoring for a distributed system
- Configure appropriate backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Optimize for the African market's connectivity challenges

## Expected Outcome
A fully automated CI/CD infrastructure that enables frequent, reliable deployments with minimal manual intervention while maintaining high system reliability. The pipeline should support the development team's velocity while ensuring production stability.
