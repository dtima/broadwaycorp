### 🔑 Strategic Technology Responsibilities

#### 1. **Architecture Leadership**

* Define and document the **multi-zone scalable microservices architecture**
* Design for **resilience, high-availability, edge caching, and data partitioning**
* Ensure separation of concerns across domains: Listings, Messaging, Business Matching, AdminOps, and AgentOps
* Implement uniform error handling framework across all services
* Design socket.io based real-time features with Redis adapter for horizontal scaling

#### 2. **Infrastructure & DevOps Governance**

* Oversee GCP infrastructure (Cloud Run, GKE, Cloud SQL, Firebase), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), and environment segregation
* Drive **zero-downtime deployments**, auto-scaling policies, and GitOps for infrastructure-as-code (Terraform)
* Ensure platform can handle surges from traffic, promotional campaigns, or viral business growth
* Implement automated performance regression detection
* Design container orchestration strategy with Kubernetes (GKE Autopilot)

#### 3. **Team Leadership & Engineering Culture**

* Mentor engineering leads, QA, DevOps, security, and product teams
* Set coding standards, architecture review processes, and feature rollout strategy
* Cultivate a **culture of performance, security, and user-first thinking**
* Establish component-based architecture with reusable UI patterns
* Set up performance budgets and mobile-first design principles

#### 4. **Security & Compliance**

* Define end-to-end security posture: Firebase Auth, data isolation, file access control, rate limiting, secrets management
* Ensure GDPR-equivalent data privacy compliance, and regional legal alignment (POPIA, NDPR) for data locality
* Design secure messaging workflows (secure socket connections, abuse reporting, content moderation)
* Implement gated-access architecture with role-based authorization
* Set up multi-factor authentication for financial transactions and sensitive operations

#### 5. **Product & Feature Velocity**

* Work with Product leads to map scalable MVP → V1.0 → V2.0 release cadence
* Prioritize architectural foundations (e.g., webhooks, APIs, caching) to avoid future refactors
* Help define **internal developer platform (IDP)** for faster feature deployment
* Design subscription management system supporting market-specific tiers
* Implement progressive form submission system with offline capabilities

#### 6. **Performance & Observability**

* Define SLAs, SLOs, and KPIs for system health, latency, error budgets
* Architect a monitoring and alerting ecosystem: GCP Monitoring, Sentry, LogRocket, OpenTelemetry
* Benchmark LCP, FID, CLS, TTI against mobile-first experience standards with specific targets:
  - LCP: ≤2.5s on 3G, ≤1.5s on 4G
  - FID: ≤100ms on all connections
  - CLS: ≤0.1 on all devices
  - TTI: ≤5s on 3G, ≤3s on 4G
