## API Contract Checklist

- [ ] Handlers/Server Actions use strong types and return correct HTTP status codes
- [ ] Zod schemas for body/query/params; helpful, structured error messages
- [ ] Authentication/authorization enforced where required (Firebase custom claims)
- [ ] Logging on errors and critical paths without leaking PII

## Security/Perf Checklist

- [ ] No secrets/PII in logs; apply strict security headers and CSP per `README.md`
- [ ] API typical latency under 500ms; avoid N+1; ensure necessary indexes; efficient queries
- [ ] Client: keep bundles lean; prefer Suspense/streaming; image optimization via Next/Image

## HALT Protocol

If ambiguity or conflict blocks a safe solution:

- Respond with `HALT_DUE_TO_CONFLICT`
- Ask 3–5 targeted questions to unblock
