But our mission goes beyond innovation—it’s rooted in empowerment. We host community training programs that open doors for:
• Aspiring farmers and agriculture enthusiasts
• Students and educators seeking practical experience
• Underprivileged individuals working to overcome economic hardship
Through forums, workshops, and interactive sessions, we teach accessible agricultural practices that uplift communities and create pathways out of poverty and food scarcity. Our training modules include:
• Urban and rural farming techniques
• Composting, soil health, and regenerative methods
• Affordable livestock and aquaculture systems
• Sustainable crop cycles and market-readiness strategies
Every Broadway farm is a learning ground, every session a step toward self-reliance, and every participant a potential changemaker in Africa’s agricultural future.

🌾 Broadway Farmhouse:

At Broadway Farmhouse, we lead the charge in agricultural innovation—merging tradition with technology to build smarter, more sustainable food systems across Africa. Our work spans smart farming, livestock breeding, aquaculture, and crop science, with cutting-edge solutions like greenhouse automation and our flagship initiative: the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) protein system.
🐛 BSF: The Backbone of Sustainable Farming
The BSF project is not just an innovation—it’s a strategic foundation for the success and scalability of Broadway Farmhouse. These remarkable insects:
• Convert organic waste into high-quality protein and compost
• Serve as nutrient-rich feed for poultry, fish, and livestock
• Reduce dependence on expensive commercial feeds
• Improve soil health through their byproduct: frass (natural fertilizer)
• Operate in low-resource environments, making them ideal for rural and urban farms alike
By integrating BSF systems into our farm operations, we achieve:
• Significant cost reduction in feed and fertilizer
• Circular farming models that minimize waste and maximize output
• Scalable solutions for food security and climate resilience
BSF is more than a project—it’s a proof of concept for Africa’s ability to lead in regenerative agriculture.

These systems are designed to thrive in low-resource settings, with offline capabilities, solar integration, and multilingual interfaces that reflect Africa’s diversity.

---

🌍 Training the Next Generation of Tech Leaders
We believe Africa’s future lies in homegrown innovation. That’s why we train:
• Students and young professionals in practical IT systems, coding, and hardware deployment
• Teachers and school administrators in digital literacy and educational tech integration
• Community leaders and technicians in maintaining and scaling infrastructure locally
Our training programs blend hands-on labs, modular toolkits, and real-world simulations, preparing participants to lead digital transformation in their own communities.
