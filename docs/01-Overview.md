# 01 - Project Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Broadway Corporation official website project.

**Goal:** To create a comprehensive, modern, and mobile-first website serving as the central online platform for Broadway Corporation, showcasing its holding structure with Broadway Enterprise and Broadway Farmhouse. The site aims to inform potential clients, partners, investors, and the public about the corporation's diverse activities in science, education, agriculture, and community development.

**Key Features:**

*   Detailed sections for the holding company, Broadway Enterprise, and Broadway Farmhouse.
*   Information on services, research, products, and future projects.
*   Multilingual support (English & French).
*   Admin dashboard for content management (pages, news) and subscriber management.
*   SEO optimization.
*   Mobile-first responsive design.

**Technology Snapshot:**

The project leverages a modern tech stack including React (Vite), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, Supabase for the backend, and will incorporate robust SEO and Internationalization (English/French). Detailed architectural choices are documented in `02-Architecture.md`.

*(Note: The specific Internationalization library needs to be finalized, e.g., i18next).*

This website will present a professional and informative face for Broadway Corporation and its subsidiaries.
